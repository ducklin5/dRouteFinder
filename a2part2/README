2 directories, 18 files

consts_and_types.h
	* contains and declares all the constant variables and types that are used throughout the entirety of the code

lcd_image.h and lcd_image.cpp
	* Allows you to draw patches of .lcd images on the display.   

map_drawing.h and map_drawing.cpp
	* Functions to draw the map and manipulate the coordinates for the map/cursor
   view.

circuit-wiring.txt
	* Wiring instructions for the Arduino, Joystick and two buttons

Makefile
	* Standard Arduino Makefile

edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	* contains all the edmonton road data

diagraph.h contains definition of 1 class:
	* Digraph class along with its properties and methods

diagraph.cpp contains:
	* implementation of digraph class methods

wdigraph.h contains 1 class:
	* WDigraph : Digraph extention class for weighted Digraphs

dijkastra.h contains dijkastra function definition

dijkastra.cpp contains dijkastra function implementation

heap.h and heap.cpp contain definition and implementation of the heap class

server.cpp contains the main server function

Makefile Targets :
	> SERVER
	* make ( server ): Builds the server an all the dependent object files
	
	> Objects (./obj/)
	* make heap.o
	* make dijkastra.o
	* make digraph.o
	* make server.o 

	> Misc
	* make clean: Delets object files and executables
	* make debug: cleans the project and buidls a debug version of the project

-- Wiring Instructions --
See circuit-wiring.txt for details on how the Arduino board, Adafruit TFT Display,
Joystick and Zoom in & out buttons are to be wired

-- Program Usage --
Usage:
	In one terminal run the following command while in the client directory:
		Make upload to upload the entire project to the arduino board
		

	In another terminal run these commands while in the server directory:
		make    # to build the entire project
		./server inputCommand.txt output.txt # to run server

	Then, use the joystick to navigate the map and press down on the joystick button to select
	a location for the beginning coordinates of the route and then press down on the joystick button again
	at another location to select the the end coordinates of the route. It should say "Reeceiving Waypoint"
	green bar in the bottom of the screen and after a few seconds a path should be highlighted in blue,
	if there is one, and if none exists, it should say "NO PATH"
